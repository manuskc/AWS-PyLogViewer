Hi!

This application is to aggregate logs from all machines on aws cloud and provide a UI to sort and filter logs based on various parameters.

Yes, i know there are tons of awsome solutions available out there which serves the same purpose and are much more powerful, but this is my hack and i love it!

Let me know your feedback when you use it :)

HOW TO USE:
1) Repalce admin.ssh with your private key
2) Update aws username in logger.sh
3) Update mongo db details in suit_up.sh
4) Update server.txt with url's of all instances

TO RUN:
$ ./suit_up.sh

COMING UP:
Code clean up
Move all configuration parameter to one file
Make this project more awesome!

Thank you!!
Manu
